  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in European
              countries varies considerably. We analyzed data from the fifth
              European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) to explore the role of
              personal, occupational, and social risk factors in determining
              the national prevalence of musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Over
              the course of 2010, 43 816 subjects from 34 countries were
              interviewed. We analyzed the one-year prevalence of back and
              neck/upper-limb pain. Individual-level risk factors studied
              included: sex; age; educational level; socioeconomic status;
              housework or cooking; gardening and repairs; somatizing tendency;
              job demand-control; six physical occupational exposures; and
              occupational group. Data on national socioeconomic variables were
              obtained from Eurostat and were available for 28 countries. We
              fitted Poisson regression models with random intercept by
              country. RESULTS: The main analysis comprised 35 550 workers.
              Among individual-level risk factors, somatizing tendency was the
              strongest predictor of the symptoms. Major differences were
              observed by country with back pain more than twice as common in
              Portugal (63.8\%) than Ireland (25.7\%), and prevalence rates of
              neck/upper-limb pain ranging from 26.6\% in Ireland to 67.7\% in
              Finland. Adjustment for individual-level risk factors slightly
              reduced the large variation in prevalence between countries. For
              back pain, the rates were more homogenous after adjustment for
              national socioeconomic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis
              indicates substantial variation between European countries in the
              prevalence of back and neck/upper-limb pain. This variation is
              unexplained by established individual risk factors. It may be
              attributable in part to socioeconomic differences between
              countries, with higher prevalence where there is less risk of
              poverty or social exclusion.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing allows the study of both gene
              expression changes and transcribed mutations, providing a highly
              effective way to gain insight into cancer biology. When planning
              the sequencing of a large cohort of samples, library size is a
              fundamental factor affecting both the overall cost and the
              quality of the results. Here we specifically address how overall
              library size influences the detection of somatic mutations in
              RNA-seq data in two acute myeloid leukaemia datasets. RESULTS :
              We simulated shallower sequencing depths by downsampling 45 acute
              myeloid leukaemia samples (100 bp PE) that are part of the
              Leucegene project, which were originally sequenced at high depth.
              We compared the sensitivity of six methods of recovering
              validated mutations on the same samples. The methods compared are
              a combination of three popular callers (MuTect, VarScan, and
              VarDict) and two filtering strategies. We observed an incremental
              loss in sensitivity when simulating libraries of 80M, 50M, 40M,
              30M and 20M fragments, with the largest loss detected with less
              than 30M fragments (below 90\%, average loss of 7\%). The
              sensitivity in recovering insertions and deletions varied
              markedly between callers, with VarDict showing the highest
              sensitivity (60\%). Single nucleotide variant sensitivity is
              relatively consistent across methods, apart from MuTect, whose
              default filters need adjustment when using RNA-Seq. We also
              analysed 136 RNA-Seq samples from the TCGA-LAML cohort (50 bp PE)
              and assessed the change in sensitivity between the initial
              libraries (average 59M fragments) and after downsampling to 40M
              fragments. When considering single nucleotide variants in
              recurrently mutated myeloid genes we found a comparable
              performance, with a 6\% average loss in sensitivity using 40M
              fragments. CONCLUSIONS: Between 30M and 40M 100 bp PE reads are
              needed to recover 90-95\% of the initial variants on recurrently
              mutated myeloid genes. To extend this result to another cancer
              type, an exploration of the characteristics of its mutations and
              gene expression patterns is suggested.",

              popular and robust method for the characterization of relative
              protein abundance between samples. Many analytical pipelines
              exist for the automation of this analysis, and some tools exist
              for the subsequent representation and inspection of the results
              of these pipelines. Mass Dynamics 1.0 (MD 1.0) is a web-based
              analysis environment that can analyze and visualize LFQ data
              produced by software such as MaxQuant. Unlike other tools, MD 1.0
              utilizes a cloud-based architecture to enable researchers to
              store their data, enabling researchers to not only automatically
              process and visualize their LFQ data but also annotate and share
              their findings with collaborators and, if chosen, to easily
              publish results to the community. With a view toward increased
              reproducibility and standardization in proteomics data analysis
              and streamlining collaboration between researchers, MD 1.0
              requires minimal parameter choices and automatically generates
              quality control reports to verify experiment integrity. Here, we
              demonstrate that MD 1.0 provides reliable results for protein
              expression quantification, emulating Perseus on benchmark
              datasets over a wide dynamic range. The MD 1.0 platform is

              for older or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We
              analyzed 81 patients receiving these venetoclax-based
              combinations to identify molecular correlates of durable
              remission, response followed by relapse (adaptive resistance), or
              refractory disease (primary resistance). High response rates and
              durable remissions were typically associated with NPM1 or IDH2
              mutations, with prolonged molecular remissions prevalent for NPM1
              mutations. Primary and adaptive resistance to venetoclax-based
              combinations was most commonly characterized by acquisition or
              enrichment of clones activating signaling pathways such as FLT3
              or RAS or biallelically perturbing TP53. Single-cell studies
              highlighted the polyclonal nature of intratumoral resistance
              mechanisms in some cases. Among cases that were primary
              refractory, we identified heterogeneous and sometimes divergent
              interval changes in leukemic clones within a single cycle of
              therapy, highlighting the dynamic and rapid occurrence of
              therapeutic selection in AML. In functional studies, FLT3
              internal tandem duplication gain or TP53 loss conferred
              cross-resistance to both venetoclax and cytotoxic-based
              therapies. Collectively, we highlight molecular determinants of
